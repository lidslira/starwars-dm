## Mechanical
Below are the mechanics implemented in this demake: 

1. The game starts with the other ships already moving in the screen
1. To start the game you should just move your keyboard keys to right or left and try to hit the others ships with the backspace key
1. The platform moves to the right and left according to user commands (with two console buttons);
1. When the ends of the platform touch the ends of the screen there is a collision, preventing the platform from leaving the screen;
1. The ships shots at the main ship very quickly so you have to be fast;
1. The game ends if your ship get fired;
